# Ruby-DiD-Gathering
This a description for the project, modify later

I'll write here some objectives for now:

If the file gets too big I'll add the objectives to a separate file.

- Kinda add a character sheet for the RP
- Will add some relevant places descriptions
- Will add some relevant objects description
- Will add some rules of D&D to make the RPs feel more fun.
- Will add some abilities related to the main character.
- Will add some status conditions that characters can have.
- Will add some kind of file list to keep track of what everything has.
- Will add some more stuff when they come to my mind.
